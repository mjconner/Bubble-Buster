# Bubble Buster

This game was created as a project to demonstrate to students how to utilize Python to create something they can use for fun.

To play, simply download the project and run the BubbleBuster2.py file. This should import the classes necessary for running 
and playing the game. To quit the game at any time, close the window it is running in. Otherwise, you can start the game over 
at any time by pressing the return key ('enter').
